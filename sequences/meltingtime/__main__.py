    Computes oligo transition stats.

    SEQUENCE and SEQS arguments work as follows:

    * starting with a '5-' is an oligo binding to the 5' strand
    * starting with a '3-' is an oligo binding to the 3' strand
    * following the '5-' or '3-' must come a number indicating the position
      relative to the hairpin
    * if only '5-' '3-' are indicated or if both these and numbers are
    missing, this is expected to be the hairpin's 5' (then 3') sequence

    Example:

    ```
    >> [PROGAM] CCCCTAGGGGATTACCC 5-3GATC 3-10TAAT 5-5AGGGA -f 8.5
    ```
